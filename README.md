# Harvard's CS50x Track by Second Mind OS (SMOS)

> Track your thinking. Loop your learning. Build public artifacts. Powered by SMOS.

**Canonical template** for learning tracks, project-based skill loops, and knowledge pipelines in the 🧱 Second Mind OS Lab.

## Purpose

### **`CS50x's Learning = self-directed systems + protocol discipline + public artifacts`**

> Maximize your leverage. Build your cognitive stack. Ship high-signal work.

This is not a note-taking system.
This is not a journaling habit.
This is a **feedback loop protocol** — to think clearer, track deeper, and verify what you actually know.

This is the **official CS50x's Track** for constructing trackable learning systems from any course, project, or domain. Use this to:

- Structure your learning as **iteration cycles**, not passive consumption, verification (via P.A.C.E.R. protocol)
- Produce **trackable insights**, not fleeting thoughts, log-traceable progression
- Ship **public artifacts**, not private illusions
- Crystallize ⌬ **Mindstamps** — reusable thinking units, based on Second Mind OS OVL Protocol

> This repo to convert any study of CS50x into a systemized execution protocol.

### 🔁 P.A.C.E.R. Loop Protocol

Each learning unit runs through the **P.A.C.E.R. loop** — a minimal feedback protocol for deliberate skill formation:

| Stage     | Function                                |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `Plan`    | Define objective, scope, and constraint |
| `Act`     | Execute, build, engage with material    |
| `Check`   | Self-test, validate via examples/tests  |
| `Edit`    | Refactor, simplify, correct blindspots  |
| `Reflect` | Meta-log insights, blockers, claims     |
