# Log ‚Äî 2025-05-19-week-00-scratch

## 1. Focus Unit / Context

**Track:** cs50x  
**Week:** 00  
**Problem:** `pset0-scratch`  
**Current Phase:** Build Complete + Loop Verification  
**Related files:**

- `docs/week-00-scratch.md`
- `loop/week-00-scratch/pacer.yaml`
- `outputs/week-00-scratch/week-00-scratch-output.md`

## 2. üöß Blockers / Bugs / Blindspots

- Confusion on what technically counts as a ‚Äúscript‚Äù ‚Üí resolved via test: `new trigger block = new script`
- Misinterpretation of `custom block requirement` ‚Üí input parameter was missing in early version
- Low motivation caused by project not feeling intellectually deep despite being structurally complete
- Edge case: loop and conditional felt ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù when added only to tick checkboxes

## 3. üõ†Ô∏è Resolution / Fix Strategy

- Used checklist-based verification ‚Üí confirmed each of the 6 required elements
- Abstracted jump logic into custom block (`jumpHeight`) ‚Üí parameter added after failure in early check
- Added visual debug behavior (e.g. `say ‚ÄúPunch!‚Äù`) to verify event triggers mapped correctly
- Rewrote conditional to respond to actual state instead of hard-coded key press for clarity

## 4. üì£ Insights Claims (`‚å¨`)

- ‚å¨ Programming starts before syntax ‚Äî logic clarity precedes code
- ‚å¨ Custom blocks aren‚Äôt for reuse, they‚Äôre for **compressing intent** into addressable units
- ‚å¨ "Correct" logic isn‚Äôt meaningful if it doesn't correspond to behavioral intent

## 5. üèõ Meta Reflection (System Layer)

> What did I learn about how I learn?

- Doing ‚Äújust enough to pass‚Äù created friction with self-respect ‚Äî solution: embed personal logic into even trivial problems
- Visual programming can be reverse engineered as system diagramming ‚Üí useful for logic compression without syntax
- Ticking constraints isn‚Äôt learning ‚Äî building traceable control loops is
- Reflecting during build = stronger retention than post-mortem

## 6. Next Steps

- Finalize and submit `.sb3` after last check
- Log mindstamp to `loop/week-00-scratch/claim.md`
- Generate final public artifact at `outputs/week-00-scratch/week-00-scratch-output.md`
- Start PACER loop for Week 1 (C, memory, compiler model)
