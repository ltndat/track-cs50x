## 1. Focus Unit / Context

**Track:** cs50x
**Week:** 02
**Problem:** `pset2-scrabble, readability, caesar, substitution`
**Current Phase:** Loop Closure + Reflect Sync
**Related files:**

- `docs/week-02-arrays.md`
- `loop/week-02-arrays/pacer.yaml`
- `outputs/week-02-arrays/week-02-arrays-output.md`
- `loop/week-02-arrays/claim.md`
- `loop/week-02-arrays/reflect.md`

## 2. 🚧 Blockers / Bugs / Blindspots

- Subtle modulo misalignment in `rotate()` → `key % 26` missed → wrong ASCII wrap
- Early version of `readability.c` → L and S were computed using integer division (floor effect)
- Duplicate check logic in `substitution.c` skipped lowercase → passed invalid keys
- False sense of "fast progress" → risked shallow understanding in early psets
- System perceived “speed = cheat” → had to rethink visibility vs integrity

## 3. 🛠️ Resolution / Fix Strategy

- Shifted to **normalized data transformations** instead of inline logic
  → moved all case handling to `substitute()` abstraction
- Implemented `seen[26]` array for key validation in substitution → normalized to uppercase
- Used `printf()` trace with `argv`, `key`, and ASCII values to map runtime behavior
- Introduced deliberate submit spacing (≥ 2h for mid PSet, ≥ 4h for deep ones)
- Framed learning in system mental model, not task → reused logic patterns from Caesar in Substitution

## 4. 📣 Insights / Claims (`⌬`)

- ⌬ ASCII is not a charset. It's a coordinate system for control.
- ⌬ Validation logic must be upstream — correcting late = wasted cycles.
- ⌬ Pacing isn't for the system. It's a signal of architectural maturity.
- ⌬ When encryption is modular, logic becomes portable across problems.
- ⌬ Text → Logic → Structure → Transformation: this pipeline mirrors future AI compilers.

## 5. 🏛 Meta Reflection (System Layer)

> What did I learn about how I learn?

- I don’t code individual problems. I design **scaffold systems** for patterns.
- When I slow down to write `claim.md`, I speed up in every future implementation.
- Speed ≠ violation if traceable. But lack of trace = liability even for truth.
- Submission is not the finish line. It’s the commit hash of cognition.
- “More comfortable” track isn't easier — it’s just _less constrained by the handrails._

## 6. Next Steps

- Finalize `loop/week-02-arrays/reflect.md` → bind claims to execution
- Capture final system diagram of `cipher → normalize → map → output` pattern
- Push `outputs/week-02-arrays/week-02-arrays-output.md` with fingerprint wrap
- Anchor the next PACER loop: Week 03 – Memory (Pointers, Stack vs Heap, Recover)
