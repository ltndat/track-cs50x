# Log — 2025-05-21-week-01-c

## 1. Focus Unit & Context

**Track:** cs50x
**Week:** 01
**Problem:** `pset1-core → mario, cash, credit`
**Current Phase:** Loop Closure + Abstraction Mapping
**Related files:**

- `docs/week-01-c.md`
- `loop/week-01-c/pacer.yaml`
- `outputs/week-01-c/week-01-c-output.md`

## 2. 🚧 Blockers, Bugs, and Blindspots

- Initial false assumption: `mario more` was simpler than `mario less`
- Misalignment in `for` loop → visual asymmetry, pyramid collapse
- Luhn logic: Digit parsing was “felt” not “understood” → led to logic slip
- Defaulted to brute-force `while` loops before recognizing greedy as a domain-structure match
- Forgot newline (`\n`) caused `check50` failure despite correct logic

## 3. 🛠️ Resolution & Fix Strategy

- Refactored `credit.c` into **modular functions** → exposed thought boundaries
- Built `get_prefix()` and `get_length()` from scratch to isolate validation concerns
- Simulated Luhn by hand → regained trust in algorithm
- Applied **spatial control theory** to Mario: geometry = loop logic
- Anchored all outputs to terminal I/O, not mental simulation
- Adopted `make → ./ → check50 → style50` as a **compile-run-validate protocol**

## 4. 📣 Insight & Claims (`⌬`)

| ⌬ ID | Claim Statement                                                      | Trigger Point             |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 001  | Loop geometry = cognitive control — outer = row, inner = space/brick | `mario_more.c`            |
| 002  | Greedy works _because domain is convex_, not because it’s simple     | `cash.c` logic map        |
| 003  | Validation is not just correctness — it's protocol fidelity          | `credit.c` output logic   |
| 004  | Luhn checksum = data integrity fingerprint, not just math            | mental model shift        |
| 005  | Debugging isn't reactive — it's system tracing                       | infinite loop trace setup |

## 5. 🏛 Meta Reflection (System Layer)

> What emerged wasn’t just syntax mastery — it was **protocol literacy**.

- **I no longer write code to solve problems — I model logic to express system behavior**
- Learned to design for **loop predictability**, not just correctness
- Recognized that **terminal output is the only trustworthy reality** in C
- Modular refactor revealed hidden structure → _function = boundary of cognition_
- When I traced with `printf`, **time slowed down, logic surfaced**
- This isn’t about C — it’s about knowing where my logic ends and system reality begins

## 6. Next Steps

- Push `outputs/week-01-c/week-01-c-output.md` with refactored `credit.c`
- Escalate ⌬002 + ⌬004 into claim cards for reuse in Week 3 (Algorithms)
- Begin PACER loop for `week-02-functions`
- Template compile-run-check-style into Makefile for future reuse
