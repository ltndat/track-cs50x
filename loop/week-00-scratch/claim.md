# âŒ¬ Claim â€” Week 00: Scratch, Abstraction, Control Flow

## ðŸ“£ Claim

- **Fact Lock-in**:  
  I understand how Scratch primitives map directly to foundational CS concepts: `if` â†’ conditional branching, `repeat` â†’ loop, variables â†’ state, custom block â†’ abstraction.

- **Skill Capability**:  
  I can build a logic-driven system in Scratch that meets formal constraints (multi-sprite, branching, looping, state, abstraction) and verify it via both behavior and spec compliance.

- **Insight Shift**:  
  Programming is not writing syntax â€” it is structuring decisions, memory, and repeatable action. Abstraction is not reuse â€” it's intent compression.

## Evidence

- Verified via: [`logs/2025-05-19-week-00-scratch.md`](../../logs/2025-05-19-week-00-scratch.md)
- Output artifact: [`outputs/week-00-scratch/output.md`](../../outputs/week-00-scratch/output.md)
- Source of knowledge: CS50x Lecture 0 + Problem Set 0

## Note

This âŒ¬ **Mindstamp** represents a crystallized loop outcome.
