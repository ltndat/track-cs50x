    headline: Week 00 — Logic Without Syntax
    loop_thesis: Build structured logic using Scratch to grasp CS concepts without syntax
    key_result: Pset 0 done (3h20m)
    key_insight: “Programming is structured control over flow and state.”
    stack: CS50x + MindOS
    claim: Early log discipline compounds

    title: Programming ≠ Syntax — It’s Logic
    claim: Logic = control over flow and state. Syntax is optional.
    source:
      - logs/2025-05-19-week-00-scratch.md
      - reflect.md

  - type: SystemPrinciple
    layout: 3:2
    principle: Always define behavior first, then build logic — not syntax-first.
    origin: Block-based abstraction clarified control flow structure.
    source:
      - reflect.md
      - pacer.yaml

  - type: MetaInsight
    layout: 16:9
    meta_frame: Syntax is accidental complexity.
    meta_claim: Starting from behavior decouples syntax from systems thinking.
    loop_scope: week-00-scratch + future loops
    quote: 'I stopped stacking blocks, and started asking: What behavior am I trying to create?'

      - Sprite 1: responds to input with conditional attacks + jump logic  
      - Sprite 2: loops movement while tracking state

    tech: MIT Scratch
    runtime: ~4m total logic runtime across scripts
