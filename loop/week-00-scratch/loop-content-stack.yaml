    description: >
      First loop in the `cs50x` track. The task appeared trivial — build a Scratch project — but the loop revealed something deeper: how primitive logic patterns manifest before code.

      The context began with clarity: map Scratch elements to foundational CS logic — loops, branches, events, state. What followed was not difficulty in execution, but dissonance: doing just enough to pass felt structurally wrong. Constraints were ticked, but meaning lagged behind.

      That tension triggered hypothesis refinement: structure only becomes knowledge when abstraction carries intent. Variable blocks aren’t memory. They’re **state witnesses**. Loops aren't repetition — they’re compression of intent under control.  

      Refactoring came not from complexity, but from respect — respect for even the simplest construct to carry clarity.  

      The result: a `.sb3` artifact that ships, yes — but more than that, a mindset pivot.  
      From dragging blocks to aligning behavior.  
      From syntax-free execution to structure-aware reasoning.  
      From first click to first crystallized insight.

      “Abstraction is not for reuse — it's for compression of intent.”

      This realization clicked during refactor: creating a custom block in Scratch wasn’t to optimize code or reduce repetition — it was to make logic *readable as thought*. Intent expressed once and reused by reference — not as optimization, but as mental decluttering.

      **Abstraction ≠ simplification. It’s declaration of structure.**

      In any system — code, ops, personal OS — abstraction is what collapses noise into form. The *reason to abstract is not to shorten* but to **align logic to how the mind frames reality**.  
      This week’s Scratch loop taught:

      - Abstraction = compressing intent into callables.
      - Every event block is an agent — structure systems as agent graphs.
      - Design state before action — otherwise, you encode reaction without memory.
      - Loops aren’t to repeat; they compress controlled iteration across time.

      These hold true in logic systems, design specs, team protocol, and even calendar ops.

      **Insight doesn’t come from difficulty — it comes from friction between expected simplicity and actual complexity.**

      Week 00 wasn’t hard. But that’s why it stung.  
      The mind expected triviality, but protocol forced structure. It surfaced a meta-friction:

      - Why is something “easy” still hard to do well?
      - Why does passing constraints feel empty unless logic aligns?
      - Why does abstraction only feel “clean” when it's meaningful, not when it’s required?

      This isn’t about Scratch. It’s about how builders rebel against empty checklists and crave meaning in systems — even visual ones.  
      The loop exposed that **the problem isn’t the platform — it’s internal misalignment between *what works* and *what resonates*.**

    layout: 3:2
    artifact_name: Scratch 2-sprite system
    description: >
      A behavior-driven logic prototype built entirely with visual blocks.

      - Sprite 1: responds to user input with conditional behavior + parameterized motion  
      - Sprite 2: executes looped animation and state-linked reactions  
      - Project includes variable tracking, a custom abstraction block, and multiple reactive scripts

      Artifact verified to meet all structural constraints in CS50x Problem Set 0.

      In accordance with academic honesty policies, the `.sb3` file is not shared publicly.
      Project structure and reflections are documented in the output + loop logs.
