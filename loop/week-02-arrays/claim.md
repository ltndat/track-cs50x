# âŒ¬ Claim â€” Week 02: Arrays, Strings, Cipher Logic

## 1. ðŸ“£ Claim

- **Fact Lock-in**:
  "I understand how ASCII encoding enables string processing, scoring, and encryption through direct memory offsetting in C."

- **Skill Capability**:
  "I can design and validate modular cipher engines (Caesar, Substitution) that map char â†’ normalized â†’ transformed, with upstream CLI validation logic and runtime safety."

- **Insight Shift**:
  "Encryption is not just data scrambling â€” it's deterministic mapping over structured spaces. When modularized, it mirrors the abstraction layers of compiler phases or token transformers."

## 2. Evidence

- Verified via: [`logs/2025-05-25-week-02-arrays.md`](/logs/2025-05-25-week-02-arrays.md)
- Output artifact: [`outputs/week-02-arrays/week-02-arrays-output.md`](/outputs/week-02-arrays/week-02-arrays-output.md)
- Source of knowledge: CS50x Week 2 Lectures + PSet2 loop execution (Scrabble, Caesar, Readability, Substitution)

## 3. Note

This âŒ¬ **Mindstamp** encodes the formal closure of Week 02 under the Second Mind OS loop protocol. The cipher logic is mastered. The architecture was traced. The system-level reasoning is now embedded.
