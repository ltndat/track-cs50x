  - type: LoopSummary
    layout: 16:9
    headline: Week 02 — From Code to Cipher Systems
    loop_thesis: Translate string manipulation in C into portable transformation logic across readability and encryption problems.
    key_result: Full PSet2 delivered: Scrabble, Caesar, Readability, Substitution (under 36h)
    key_insight: “Transformation logic lives upstream — once normalized, output becomes inevitable.”
    stack: CS50x + MindOS
    claim: Pacing isn’t delay — it’s visible logic integrity.

    title: ASCII as Coordinate Math
    claim: String processing isn’t syntax — it’s spatial computation over addressable characters.

    artifact_name: Modular Cipher Systems in C
    description: >
      - `scrabble.c`: maps ASCII to scores with upper/lower handling  
      - `readability.c`: parses text to compute readability index  
      - `caesar.c`: rotates letters with modulo-mapped key  
      - `substitution.c`: validates and maps full alphabet key
    file: outputs/week-02-arrays/
    tech: C (CS50 stack)
    runtime: ~6.7h loop (build + reflect)

  - type: SystemPrinciple
    layout: 1:1
    principle: Normalize → Validate → Transform → Output.
    origin: Derived from repeated char-mapping systems that required upstream validation to prevent downstream chaos.

  - type: MetaInsight
    layout: 16:9
    meta_frame: Speed is trustless if invisible.
    meta_claim: Accelerated learning isn’t risky — unless it leaves no trace.
    loop_scope: week-02-arrays + audit-aware loops
    quote: "Speed isn’t the problem. Invisibility is."
