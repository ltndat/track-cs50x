# Reflect — Week 02: Arrays, Strings, Cipher Logic

## What clicked?

- ASCII isn’t just encoding — it’s structure. Once normalized, any string becomes computable.
- Arrays aren’t data — they’re space. Traversing them is a memory walk.
- CLI arguments (argc/argv) are not syntax quirks — they are protocol gateways between human and system input.
- Modular encryption logic (rotate, substitute) isn't about ciphers — it's about functional clarity, composability, and trust.
- Time pacing isn’t cosmetic. It is a **signal** in the audit trail — an extension of logic integrity.

## What was hard?

- Balancing speed of build vs. _visibility of cognition_. Build fast — but how to ensure that speed doesn’t signal automation?
- Debugging text-based logic can seem obvious — until an edge case breaks casing, key validation, or punctuation preservation.
- Substitution validation logic initially failed silently. Lesson: "Fail early or debug late."
- Submission risk management added a meta-layer — not technical, but strategic. Not hard — but must be conscious.

## What would you do differently?

- Move validation to _before_ thinking about transformation. Pre-clean > post-fix.
- Run more null-case / degenerate-case tests. Not just `a-z`, but `0-9`, empty string, punctuation, mixed casing.
- Track build-to-submit logic formally — not just pace, but _decision logs_.
- Externalize substitution key logic into table-driven mapping earlier. It becomes reusable.

## 🏛 Meta-level feedback

- **Protocol friction:** None. Loop fully loaded → plan to reflect was clean. No overload.
- **System effectiveness:** High. Scaffolded loop gave the mental permission to slow down and scale up simultaneously.
- **Architecture awareness:** Solidified. These problems are not "about code" — they're about how information moves, maps, and mutates.
- **Signal discipline:** Emerged. Not just what I code — but how and _when_ I signal that work is done (submit timing, reflection, trace logs).

## Spillover

- Looping through `validate → normalize → transform → emit` is now a **default pipeline pattern** in thinking, regardless of domain.
- This week wasn't about encryption. It was about _how logic stays consistent under pressure_.
- Week 03 (Recover, memory, pointer arithmetic) will likely layer on this base — not overwrite it.
