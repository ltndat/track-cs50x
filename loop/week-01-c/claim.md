# ⌬ Claim — Week 01: Procedural Control & System Fidelity

## 📣 Claim

- **Fact Lock-in**:  
  “I understand how nested `for` loops in C control spatial output — from pyramid generation to digit parsing.”

- **Skill Capability**:  
  “I can refactor procedural C code into modular, testable functions and validate logic through I/O loop tracing.”

- **Insight Shift**:  
  “Debugging is not correction — it’s control system tracing. The bug is never the bug. The misunderstanding is.”

## Evidence

- Verified via: [logs/2025-05-21-week-01-c.md](/logs/2025-05-21-week-01-c.md)
- Output artifact: [outputs/week-01-c/week-01-c-output.md](/outputs/week-01-c/week-01-c-output.md)
- Source of knowledge: CS50x Lecture 1, Problem Set 1, controlled local dev loop

## Note

This ⌬ **Mindstamp** was locked from a clean PACER loop through input validation, greedy modeling, loop-based visual logic, and checksum abstraction.  
It marks the shift from syntax awareness → protocol literacy.
