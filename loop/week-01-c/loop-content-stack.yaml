      Week 01 began not with syntax, but with control.

      The explicit goal was procedural fluency — write, compile, validate — but the hidden test was structural: could logic scale under precision, not abstraction?

      PSet1 revealed the real protocol:
      - `mario` unlocked spatial loops as geometric cognition.
      - `cash` exposed the first cognitive trap — brute force in disguise.
      - `credit` showed where logic becomes algebra, and validation becomes narrative.

      Debugging wasn’t correction — it became tracing.
      Refactor wasn’t cleanup — it became architectural alignment.

      The entire loop shifted when “pass check50” stopped being the goal. From that point on, everything coded had to withstand inspection — not from the compiler, but from the mind.

      Loop control → Output fidelity → Pattern extraction → Refactor discipline.

      By the end, the fingerprint wasn’t the code submitted — it was the internal structure forged:  
      - A mental model for loop geometry  
      - A protocol for validation-first thinking  
      - A modular instinct that replaced trial-and-error with scoped execution

      Nothing fancy. Nothing skipped. But every step was claimed, traced, and locked.

      Debugging is not correction — it’s tracing. 
      The bug rarely lives in the line that crashes. It lives upstream, in the unchecked assumption. Once I treated each print as a system probe, logic surfaced fast — not from intelligence, but from visibility.

    description: >
      Loop = Spatial Protocol 
      Every visible output in a C program is a result of a mental loop being encoded spatially. Rows = outer control, columns = inner construct. If your visual output misaligns, don’t fix the print — fix the protocol.

      MetaInsight  
      Execution ≠ Insight. Only Loops Make Insight Transferable. 
      CS50x Week 1 was passed. But nothing stuck until I looped the process: trace → fail → reflect → refactor.  
      Only then did a new trait emerge — not “I know how to write in C,” but “I know how to think in systems.”  
      Insight didn’t come from success. It came from tracing why it worked.

      Week 01 Deliverables: C as Protocol Design

      Each file here isn’t just functional — it’s traceable.  
      Built under terminal-first, printf-traced, check50-verified flow:

      - `hello.c` → Protocol bootstrap (compile → execute)  
      - `me.c` → First I/O scaffold (get_string, format logic)  
      - `mario_less.c` → Nested loop mapped to spatial symmetry  
      - `mario_more.c` → Mirrored geometry, spacing logic stabilized  
      - `cash.c` → Greedy logic modeled and validated under US coin rules  
      - `credit.c` → Full pipeline: input → checksum → prefix-branching

      Path: `outputs/week-01-c/`  
      Each file is `style50` clean and `check50` passed.  
      But more important — each represents a protocol, not just a program.

      “The compiler accepted the syntax. I accepted the logic.”
