  - type: LoopSummary
    layout: 16:9
    headline: Week 01 — C as Protocol, Not Just Code
    loop_thesis: Procedural logic becomes real only when output, loop, and control converge under structure.
    key_result: PSet1 shipped, submitted, refactored, validated (4.5h loop)
    key_insight: “Debugging is not correction — it's control tracing.”
    stack: CS50x + Second Mind OS
    claim: You don’t learn loops — you internalize spatial protocols.

    title: Control lives in trace
    claim: The bug rarely lives in the crash. It lives upstream — in an unchecked assumption.

      - `hello.c`: compiler + run pipeline sanity  
      - `mario_more.c`: nested loops → visual geometry  
      - `cash.c`: greedy logic correctness  
      - `credit.c`: checksum, modular refactor, type classification

  - type: SystemPrinciple
    layout: 1:1
    principle: Loop structure is spatial logic, not repetition.
    origin: Mario’s alignment wasn’t a loop problem — it was a protocol misalignment.

      - pacer.yaml

  - type: MetaInsight
    layout: 16:9
    meta_frame: Submission isn’t mastery. Reflection is.
    meta_claim: Insight doesn’t arrive when code runs — it arrives when the abstraction stabilizes across cases.
    loop_scope: week-01-c + all future psets
    quote: "Check50 passed, but the logic still felt fragile. That’s when I knew it wasn’t about passing."
