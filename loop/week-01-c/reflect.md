# Reflect — Week 01: C, Protocol Thinking, Loop Control

## 1. What clicked?

- **C** is not “low-level” — it is _raw-control_. Every step is yours to trace, own, and misfire.
- Nested loops aren’t just a programming construct — they’re **spatial protocols**.
- The output of a program is the _external manifestation_ of an internal cognitive loop.
- Refactoring isn’t cleanup — it’s boundary detection. Function = thought boundary.
- `make → ./ → check50` formed a repeatable execution contract — predictable and trusted.

## 2. What was hard?

- Luhn algorithm seemed trivial until simulating it manually → revealed lack of digit-control literacy.
- Mario spacing logic looked “solved” — until it broke in multi-digit alignment.
- The illusion that “pset1 is easy” hid **invisible errors**: off-by-one, misaligned assumptions, missing line breaks.
- Mental default = brute force → had to train for **elegant minimality**, not "run-then-fix".

## 3. What would you do differently?

- Begin each PSet by writing its _behavior protocol_ in pseudocode, not jumping to `main()`.
- Add auto-trace prints during build phase — only remove once logic is stable.
- Create a single dev template with `make`, `style50`, `check50`, and `run` aliases from day one.
- Treat `printf` debugging as a **first-tier instrument**, not fallback.

## 4. 🏛 Meta-level feedback

- **Protocol friction:** Low — PACER kept everything lean, minimal context-switching. No stray notes.
- **System effectiveness:** High — First time logic felt _observable_, not just _writable_.
- **Tooling:** Clean, local sandbox was worth it — trust in output = trust in self. Wouldn't trade it for codespace opacity.

## 5. Spillover

- This loop broke the “intro course = shallow” bias.
- Every future program now starts with:
  → _What is the output protocol?_
  → _What needs to be guaranteed?_
  → _How can it break if misunderstood?_
- Refactor and reflection are now tightly coupled → _modularize = crystallize cognition_
