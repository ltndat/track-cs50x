**Abstraction ≠ simplification. It’s declaration of structure.**

In any system — code, ops, personal OS — abstraction is what collapses noise into form. The _reason to abstract is not to shorten_ but to **align logic to how the mind frames reality**.
This week’s Scratch loop taught:

- Abstraction = compressing intent into callables.
- Every event block is an agent — structure systems as agent graphs.
- Design state before action — otherwise, you encode reaction without memory.
- Loops aren’t to repeat; they compress controlled iteration across time.

These hold true in logic systems, design specs, team protocol, and even calendar ops.
