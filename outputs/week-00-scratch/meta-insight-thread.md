**Insight doesn’t come from difficulty — it comes from friction between expected simplicity and actual complexity.**

Week 00 wasn’t hard. But that’s why it stung.
The mind expected triviality, but protocol forced structure. It surfaced a meta-friction:

- Why is something “easy” still hard to do well?
- Why does passing constraints feel empty unless logic aligns?
- Why does abstraction only feel “clean” when it's meaningful, not when it’s required?

This isn’t about Scratch. It’s about how builders rebel against empty checklists and crave meaning in systems — even visual ones.
The loop exposed that **the problem isn’t the platform — it’s internal misalignment between _what works_ and _what resonates_.**
