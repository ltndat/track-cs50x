# loop-summary.md

Will publish from here. Starting from Harvard. First public loop. Week 00 — cs50x.
Scratch.  
Honestly didn’t expect much. Just a box-checker to pass.

But something felt off. I had 2 sprites, 3 scripts, 1 loop, 1 if, a variable, even a custom block.

Still felt like... nothing.

That friction triggered something deeper:  
I wasn't failing, but I wasn’t building either.  
I was stacking, not thinking.

Then it clicked:

Variables aren’t memory.  
They’re **state witnesses**.  
Loops aren’t for repetition.  
They **compress intent** — under structure, under control.

So I stripped it down. Rebuilt not to pass, but to express.

The file? `.sb3`.  
The result? A small project, sure.  
But also — first crystallized insight.

Not code.  
Just logic, standing on its own.
