# Loop Insight

The system only stabilized when the upstream was owned.

At first, the bug appeared downstream — output misaligned, checksum failed, cipher skipped characters. But none of those were root. They were echoes.

Control returned the moment validation shifted to the entry point. Once the input space was locked, every downstream function became mechanical. Mapping characters wasn't fragile anymore — it was just coordinate offsets.

The deeper loop clicked: logic isn't in the transform — it's in the boundary of what enters.
