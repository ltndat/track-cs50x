Control isn't in code. It's in entropy compression.

The earlier loops tried to master logic by manipulating constructs: loops, conditionals, memory. But the deeper tension revealed itself not in complexity, but in where uncertainty lived.

Every fragile system leaked entropy â€” assumptions not locked, edge cases uncontained, inputs allowed to wander.

The shift wasn't in writing better code. It was architectural: all fragile execution is unresolved ambiguity upstream. Once entry constraints stabilized, downstream behavior collapsed into inevitability.

The loop isn't a process. It's an entropy funnel.
