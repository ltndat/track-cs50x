# System Principle

Normalize early. Validate upstream. Transform downstream.

Every transformation pipeline carries entropy. The closer correction happens to input, the lower the total system disorder.

Arrays weren’t about data — they were controlled memory. Ciphers weren’t encryption — they were constrained maps.

The system breathes not by writing cleaner functions, but by eliminating unqualified states before any function runs.

All fragile code is late validation code.
