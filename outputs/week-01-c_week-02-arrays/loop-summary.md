# Loop Summary

Two problems, one protocol.

It began with loops and pyramids. Not to solve, but to listen — to whether structure would reveal itself before syntax tried to define it.

`mario`, `cash`, `credit`: not programs, but probes. Each function boundary became a thought constraint. Every `for` loop mapped to geometry. `Greedy` wasn’t just an algorithm — it was a mirror. Control was earned not by writing, but by tracing. Checksum wasn't about digits, it was about trust.

But it didn’t stop.

The next loop didn’t scale complexity — it shifted substrate.
From visible shape to invisible string. From spatial logic to memory-walks. From `printf` to `valgrind`, from `get_int()` to `argv[1]`.

`caesar`, `substitution`, `scrabble`, `readability`. Each one was a cipher, but none were about security. They were about transformation pipelines. Normalize → validate → transform → emit.
ASCII was no longer a table. It was a coordinate system. Modulo wasn’t arithmetic — it was architecture. When logic lived upstream, output became inevitable.

This wasn’t a C tutorial. It was **an internal system update**.
Functions now mean boundaries of thought. Loops = temporal symmetry. CLI = protocol bridge. And speed? It’s not the villain — invisibility is.

The loop closed with no ceremony. But the trace remains.

Submission was just a signal.
The loop wasn’t built to pass.
It was built to persist.
