Week 01 began not with syntax, but with control.

The explicit goal was procedural fluency — write, compile, validate — but the hidden test was structural: could logic scale under precision, not abstraction?

PSet1 revealed the real protocol:

- `mario` unlocked spatial loops as geometric cognition.
- `cash` exposed the first cognitive trap — brute force in disguise.
- `credit` showed where logic becomes algebra, and validation becomes narrative.

Debugging wasn’t correction — it became tracing.
Refactor wasn’t cleanup — it became architectural alignment.

The entire loop shifted when “pass check50” stopped being the goal. From that point on, everything coded had to withstand inspection — not from the compiler, but from the mind.

Loop control → Output fidelity → Pattern extraction → Refactor discipline.

By the end, the fingerprint wasn’t the code submitted — it was the internal structure forged:

- A mental model for loop geometry
- A protocol for validation-first thinking
- A modular instinct that replaced trial-and-error with scoped execution

Nothing fancy. Nothing skipped. But every step was claimed, traced, and locked.
